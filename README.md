# 0x1d7's Quality of Life Mod

This mod for HBS' Battletech provides quality of life improvements. _This is a work-in-progress_. Testers are appreciated, as are other QoL suggestions.

## Skip Straight into Battle
After selecting your Lance, you can skip straight into battle! While you still need to wait for the mission to load, the button click to deploy is clicked for you. In addition, messages from Darius and enemy lances are completely skipped at the start of a mission.

## Skip Transit Animations
When navigating from star system to star system, some animations are skippable. This mod automatically skips them instead of having to press the Escape key. Note that one animation, leaving the dropship is not (currently) skippable as that animation sets up additional parameters behind the scenes. The dropship jumps are also not skippable as they're used as a hidden loading screen.
